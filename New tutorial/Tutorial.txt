Right hello hello

Today I will teach you how to ss a minecraft autistic hacker that needs to be banned from your server.

And there is 0 videos I've found that covers this (the other videos are about Java ect.)
and so I thought why not show the people how to ss Minecraft-BEDROCK-Edition. (NOT JAVA)

Right lets start!



(I will write down my notes on what you should watch out for and some basic tips.)

Horion is the most common you can find people using.


Make sure they are always checked because people tend to hide stuff like that

(if you are a staff I would recommend banning the player you are ssing when their Recycle bin is empty because it is a very common thing that cheaters do)

Btw these will all be in the description.

Make sure the dates are correct. (in my case they match)

JNativeHooks are a type autoclickers written in Java (Example of one Veneclicker)

In the history there is usually the stuff that the user has done in the past or in the present. (In my case I deleted them)

If the user has used Horion before there should be a file in there called "default.h" (In my case I can't even open Horion lol)

Find anything sus in the download / desktop / documents 

What i did was a search in my whole User file to find a file called "Horion.zip" (WATCH OUT THIS IS CASE SENSETIVE<- Means you have to type exactly what the original file is called. for example )
